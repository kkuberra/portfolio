				<p>Hello, welcome to my website! Here you will find a few of my favorite projects that I've created over the past few years. I am also excited to show you some of my web development projects that I have started to gain a passion for.
				<p>Ever since I can remember I've always had a curiosity and an eye for all things graphics, whether it's my love for typography from old vintage advertisements to the many modern and contemporary ways we use to express ourselves today. Working over a
				decade in the large format printing and signage industry has helped me gain a better understanding and an appreciation for ever-evolving trends and effective ways to build brands and effective marketing identities. With my background and eagerness to
				never stop learning, I hope to find the right fit with an employer that I can grow with and thrive!</p></p>
